## uWSGI configuration example

Satosa proxy and his istance Satosa-saml2spid are served by uWSGY. NGINX work as HTTP <-> uWSGI proxy to one or more Satosa-saml2spid istance.

General information on uWSGI ini configuration:

* The uWSGI configuration Must be start with `[uwsgi]`
* Can be contain multiple arbitrary keys to generate structurated values, look `base` and `ckdir` keys as example.
* Must be contain the `socket` key with the file or the addres to expose the service
* can be contain `uid` and `gid` keys to define user and and group to execute the service
* If `uid` and `gid` keys are note defined, the service is started as current user and primary group
* must be contain `callable` or `module` key to run the correct application
* `ckdir` key define the derectory from the application must be executed
* if `pidfile` key is set with a file path, uWSGI on startup generate or update the file with the current Process ID (PID)
* You can add the `virtualenv` key with the path of [Python Virtual Env](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments), uWSGI search the dipendences in his VirtualEnv
* If `harakiri` key is set with a number, the inactive process are restarted after the setted seconds
* You can add `pythonpath` key to set the Python runtime path
* If `virtualenv` and `pythonpath` keys are not set, uWSGI use the system default path


On follow we present some uWSGI configuration example for various situations.

### local instance with logrotate on localhost
#### important note:
* The project is located in `%(base)/%(project)` where `/opt` is `base` and `satosa-saml2spid` is `project`
* uWSGI server is runned with user: 'satosa' and group `satosa`. You can change this with the key `uid` and `gid`
* the VirtualEnv path is `%(base)/%(project)/env` or `/opt/satosa-saml2spid/env`
* Log are saved at `/var/log/uwsgi/%(project).log` or `/var/log/uwsgi/satosa-saml2spid.log`
* pid are saved at `/var/log/uwsgi/%(project).pid` or `/var/log/uwsgi/satosa-saml2spid.pid`
* the configuration is reloaded when change the date of `%(base)/%(project)/proxy_conf.yaml` or `/opt/satosa-saml2spid/proxy_conf.yaml`
* uwsgi server listen at 127.0.0.1:3002, only for local host!

### for docker container or simple local istance
#### Important note
* The project is located in `/satosa_proxy`
* uWSGI server is runned with user: 'root' and group `root`. You can change this with the key `uid` and `gid`
* Isn't user the virtualENV, uWSGY work with python system default 
* The log are printed on STDOUT
* pid are saved at `/satosa_proxy/%(project).pid`
* the configuration is reloaded when change the date of `/satosa_proxy/proxy_conf.yaml
* uwsgi server listen in `0.0.0.0:10000` and accept connection from all
