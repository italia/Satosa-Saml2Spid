# Developing a Python dependency of this project

This document contains a suggested approach on how to develop or modify a Python library that uses the current project Docker as a test or develop environment.
For example, those instructions can be used to create a developer environment for further development of [eudi-wallet-it-python](https://github.com/italia/eudi-wallet-it-python).
The instructions below are intended to be a suggestion or a guideline rather than a standard.

## Step 0: Identify which Python dependency requires development

We assume that the developer needs to develop a modified version of the library [eudi-wallet-it-python](https://github.com/italia/eudi-wallet-it-python) which is a dependency of the container `satosa-saml2spid`.
A local copy of the library is required.
We assume that the project eudi-wallet-it-python has been cloned in the folder `/home/username/my/development/folder/eudi-wallet-it-python/pyeudiw`. The path prefix `/home/username/my/development/folder/` is an example and should be replaced here with the location of your own development package.

## Step 1: Set environment variable

Set the environment variable `SATOSA_DEBUG=true`. This can be done either in the terminal with the command `export SATOSA_DEBUG=true`, or by updating the file [.env](Docker-compose/.env) by appending the entry `SATOSA_DEBUG=true`.

## Step 2: Update the docker volume by binding the local development directory

In the file [docker-compose.yml](Docker-example/docker-compose.yml), among the volumes of the container `satosa-saml2spid`, add the entry
    
        volumes:
            - /home/username/my/development/folder/eudi-wallet-it-python/pyeudiw:/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pyeudiw:rw

This will replace the installed dependency package with your own local code.

**NOTE:** at the time of writing, container volume is binded to the location `/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages`, but your location might be different as it always reference the Python version that is awailable in the container, which in this case is `Python3.12`. Check che actual python version of your container before completing with this step.

## Step 3: Run the container

Launch the script [run-docker-compose.sh](Docker-compose/run-docker-compose.sh). This will launch the docker composition that includes the container `satosa-saml2spid`.

## Step 4 (Optional): Install further dependencies in the container

If your version of the library contains further dependencies, or if you want to install development only dependencies such as, say [pdbpp](https://github.com/pdbpp/pdbpp), you can create a new image that contains the required dependency or execute a terminal (such as a `bash`) within the container and install it manually, therefore commit the changes to the docker container, as shown in the next section.
Two different options are presented, based on your preferences or requirements.

### Option 4.1: Add the dependency to an existing container

The following steps instructs on how to install a new pip dependency to an existing container. We will assume that the container has name `satosa-saml2spid`.

1. Enter in the container environment with `docker exec -it satosa-saml2spid bash`. Note that to perform the `docker exec` command, the container MUST be running.
2. Execute the following commands to install you own dependencies; replace `new_package_name` with the new dependency

        source /.venv/bin/activate
        pip3 install new_package_name

3. Exit from the container area with Docker escape control sequence, that is, `Ctrl+P` followed by `Ctrl+Q`.
4. Freeze the changes with the command `docker container commit satosa-saml2spid`.
5. Stop and then restart the container.

At the end of the procedure, you will find the required dependency as part of your container.

### Options 4.2: Create a new image Dockerfile

The following steps instruct on how to create a new image with the new required python dependency. This new image will be the base of the updated container.

1. Stop the container `satosa-saml2spid` with the command `docker stop satosa-saml2spid`.
2. Create a new folder.
3. Inside the new folder, create a Dockerfile with the following content, replacing `new_package_name` with the target package:

        FROM ghcr.io/italia/satosa-saml2spid:latest
        RUN source /.venv/bin/activate && pip3 install new_package_name

4. Build the new image: `docker build . -t satosa-saml2spid`.
5. Modify docker-compose.yml to replace the old image reference with `satosa-saml2spid`.
6. Re-run `docker compose up`.

**NOTE:** if the image is already built locally, you can simply update the existing Dockerfile instead of creating a new one from scratch.

## Step 5 (Optional): Insert a breakpoint to check that your setting is working as intended

1. Stop the container `docker stop satosa-saml2spid`.
2. Add the line `breakpoint()` to a file of that package eudi-wallet-it-python that requires investigation.
3. Start the container `docker start satosa-saml2spid`.

If everything worked as intended, the program execution should stop at the given `breakpoint()`. To further investigate the state of the program at the time it was stopped, you can use the command `docker attach statosa-saml2spid` in a new terminal.
